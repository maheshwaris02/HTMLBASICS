		Boost Your Child's Self-Esteem
	Kids start developing their sense of self as babies when they see themselves through their parents' eyes. Your tone of voice, your body language, and your every expression are absorbed by your kids. Your words and actions as a parent affect their developing self-esteem more than anything else.

	<td>The world is dealing with the paradox of choice and manufacturers are going to new lengths to make their product stand out from the lot. This translates to increased expenditure on advertisements and marketing, and innovative ads that are hard to miss. While these advertisements can be informative and help you make an informed choice, they may have certain effects on children and go as far as influence their decisions and even personality, in some cases.</td>

	<td>Advertisements can have a lasting impact on children. They prompt children to mimic stunts and make them believe in exaggerated product outcomes. If you want to learn about the effects of advertisements on children, this post is for you.Children remember advertisements as they are constantly broadcast on television and other media channels.</td>
	<td>Advertising to children can take place on traditional media such as television, radio, print, new media, internet and other electronic media. The use of packaging, in-store advertising, event sponsorship, and promotions can also be classified as advertising.

	<td>Here’s a rundown of essential social media marketing advertising statistics that every marketer should keep in their back pocket to help inform their 2022 ads strategy.</td>
	<td>The central idea or message which is reflected in all the advertisements in an ad campaign of a product is termed as advertising theme. The objective of an advertising theme is to position the product firmly into the minds of target customers. Hence, a series of ads are created under an ad campaign having same theme so that customers receive the same message in several ways and record the same thing in their mind. </td>
	<td>A boy and a girl are sitting on a bench. The girl asks the boy if they are 'girlfriend-boyfriend' and the boy says no. He says that girlfriends are very demanding and that does not suit him. The girl coos that all that she needs is an Aloo Tikki. Then a very tempting and 'affordable' Aloo Tikki of a well-known fast food chain flashes on the screen. The boy suddenly changes his mind and tells the girl that they are 'boyfriend-girlfriend.' The boy and girl in this ad are 10-year-olds!</td>
	<td>Advertisers know that the earlier kids learns about a brand, the more likely they'll be to buy the product later (or beg their parents to buy it). Marketing to preschoolers mostly entails commercials on television (or streaming services), since television is still the dominant medium for young children.</td>
	<td>Today’s 8- to 18-year-olds consume an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes of screen media per day. And, given that kids often interact with more than one medium at a time, today’s youth pack a staggering 10 hours and 45 worth of media content into those 7.5 hours.</td>
	<td>The advertising industry spends $12 billion per year on ads targeted to children, bombarding young audiences with persuasive messages through media such as television and the Internet. The average child is exposed to more than 40,000 TV commercials a year, according to studies. And ads are reaching children through new media technologies and even in schools--with corporate-sponsored educational materials and product placements in students' textbooks.</td>
	<td>We constantly hear such moans from our children (from toddlers to teens), especially when we are busy doing something else. Our natural instinct is to either respond with a reluctant 'YES' just to get them off our backs or a fuming 'NO' to show who is in charge. Either way, you, the parent loses!</td>

<TD> Catch Kids Being Good
Have you ever stopped to think about how many times you react negatively to your kids in a given day? You may find yourself criticizing far more often than complimenting. How would you feel about a boss who treated you with that much negative guidance, even if it was well-intentioned?
The more effective approach is to catch kids doing something right: "You made your bed without being asked — that's terrific!" or "I was watching you play with your sister and you were very patient." These statements will do more to encourage good behavior over the long run than repeated scoldings.
</TD>

<td>This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus, AD counting years from the start of this epoch and BC denoting years before the start of the era. There is no year zero in this scheme; thus the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC. This dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus, but was not widely used until the 9th century.[4] [5]</td>

	<td>Persuasion to purchase a product they like can be a real problem. As advertisers direct their marketing strategies towards children, the parents may have a stubborn child on their hands demanding that they buy a specific product for him.</td>

	<td>According to the American Psychological Association, an average child is exposed to more than 40,000 TV commercials a year. Studies also suggest that children can recall the content after a single exposure to a commercial and may express a desire to buy the product Thus, it is imperative to understand the impact of advertising on children. </td>
	<td>In the 20th century, the compulsory education of children was established which consequently made school-age children the target audiences of many publications.[3]
	The publications in an attempt to raise potential sales, comic book promotion to the youth market rose in the 20th century.</td>
	<td>By now, everyone doing social understands that you can’t get by on organic posts alone. Brands need to tie in paid advertising to work alongside social media holistically. Each strategy positively impacts the other, so make sure you’re putting aside some dollars to invest in paid social alongside organic in 2022.</td>
	<td>i. Comfort: This theme is generally used in cars, air conditioners, home durables products
		ii. Beauty: This theme is generally expressed for the beauty products, cosmetics etc.
		iii. Family values: This theme is prominently used by Coca-Cola through their ads. Its main competitor use the theme of energy and youth in its ad campaigns. They use different themes for the similar product because they target different customer segment.
		iv. Prestige: Luxury products like jewelry, costly goods like refrigerators, high end automobiles show this theme to position themselves.
		v. Other commonly used themes are patriotism, courage, fear, achievement, self-confidence etc.</td>
	<td>This ad may seem cute and innocent to watch, but the message it conveys is not that innocent. Ten-year-olds talking about a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship is not the kind of message that parents want their children to absorb.</td>
	<td>As for preteens, advertisers spend many billions of dollars per year making sure their products get in front of their eyes, and they have more places to capture their attention: television, the Internet, games, movies, apps -- you name it. Advertisers also know that kids greatly influence their parents' buying decisions, to the tune of $500 billion per year. The most significant aspect of marketing to preteens, though, is that now they can talk back. Although companies are limited in the data they can collect from kids under 13, they can still gain insights into their behavior and preferences.</td>
	<td>If you find limiting screen time difficult, start by establishing “screen-free” zones in your home, restricting screen time during homework and meals, and/or limiting viewing to ad-free programs or games. A 2014 study found that children whose parents set more limits on the amount and content of media viewed got more sleep, gained less weight, got better grades, exhibited more cooperative social behaviors, and were less aggressive with their peers.</td>
	<td>In February, APA's Council of Representatives adopted the task force's policy and research recommendations to help counter the potential harmful effects of advertising on children, particularly children ages 8 and younger who lack the cognitive ability to recognize advertising's persuasive intent.</td>
	<td>We constantly hear such moans from our children (from toddlers to teens), especially when we are busy doing something else.

<TD> Set Limits and Be Consistent With Your Discipline
	Discipline is necessary in every household. The goal of discipline is to help kids choose acceptable behaviors and learn self-control. They may test the limits you establish for them, but they need those limits to grow into responsible adults.

	<td>Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or Common Era (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). Astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years (but not for BC years in the case of astronomical years; e.g., 1 BC is year 0, 45 BC is year −44).</td>

	<td>The message of the advertisement may be interpreted the wrong way and children may focus mainly on the negatives rather than the positives.
Certain advertisements portray stunts that can be very dangerous. Although they do come with a statutory warning, it may often be ignored, and kids may attempt to imitate these stunts.</td> 

	<td>Research suggests that children who watch too much television are likely to demand more toys or other products. Until they are teens, children would not be able to identify advertisements as marketing messages, meaning they could perceive these messages and exaggerations as truths and demand to buy those products. In some cases, these ads can stay with them until they become adults </td>
	<td>With this rise in targeted advertising, concerns prevailed regarding advertising's ability to easily manipulate young children due to a limited ability to comprehend the implicit objective of advertisers.[6] Such concerns drove the introduction of national laws and advertising standards. Through the 1970s, the Big Three television networks in the United States did not view children as a desirable target audience, because they had no income of their own.</td>
	<td>With so many channels, running ads on social media can feel overwhelming at times. But don’t worry. We’ll guide you through vital ad stats to help you understand where you should be allocating your ad budget and resources for successful campaigns.</td>
	<td>i. Coca-Cola Ad Theme: Coca-Cola has positioned itself as a product which care about relations and values. The same is reflected from its ad campaigns. In every ad of Coca-Cola, there will be a family rejoicing together over some event with Coca-Cola

	</td>
	<td>Certainly the power of persuasion of ad messages is compelling. Studies have shown that after just one exposure to a commercial, children can recall the ad's content and have a desire for the product.</td>
	<td>Finally, teens are one of the most important demographics for marketers. Their brand preferences are still gelling, they have money to spend, and they exert a strong influence on their parents' spending (even on big-ticket items such as cars).</td>
	<td>When you say no to a screen or gadget, say yes to something your child really wants: time with you. Encourage fun family activities like bike rides, board games, and walks around the neighborhood. Studies have found that exposure to natural settings may be effective in reducing symptoms of ADHD and that children’s stress levels fall within minutes of seeing green spaces.</td>
	<td>And, APA has been making strides in getting some of the task force's recommendations put into action. Among its recommendations, the task force calls for advocacy efforts for legislation to restrict advertising targeted to children 8 years old and younger and for conducting more research showing the influence advertising has on young children (see sidebar for the full list of recommendations).</td>
	<td>Get your child's creative juices flowing. Provide your child with age-appropriate art and craft materials and involve him in activities based on his ability and skill level. Encourage him to keep improving his skills. Don't expect perfection. Instead, acknowledge the effort and encourage his creative expression.</td>

<td> Make Time for Your Kids
	It's often hard for parents and kids to get together for a family meal, let alone spend quality time together. But there is probably nothing kids would like more. Get up 10 minutes earlier in the morning so you can eat breakfast with your child or leave the dishes in the sink and take a walk after dinner. Kids who aren't getting the attention they want from their parents often act out or misbehave because they're sure to be noticed that way.

	<td>The Anno Domini dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus to enumerate the years in his Easter table. His system was to replace the Diocletian era that had been used in older Easter tables, as he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.[9] The last year of the old table, Diocletian Anno Martyrium 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, Anno Domini 532.

	<td>The message of the advertisement may be interpreted the wrong way and children may focus mainly on the negatives rather than the positives.
Certain advertisements portray stunts that can be very dangerous. Although they do come with a statutory warning, it may often be ignored, and kids may attempt to imitate these stunts.</td>

	<td>Advertisements on alcohol and tobacco can have significant repercussions on children and teens. Tobacco and alcohol advertising often targets the vulnerabilities of youth, presenting them as the key to improving self-image and independence, thus provoking children to consume them.</td>
	<td>Before national laws and advertising standards were introduced, a content creator on YouTube could promote their own merchandising during a video with no distinction between the video and the advertisement.
	A late-August 2016 report indicated that various Internet streaming services, such as Netflix have prevented children of the 2010s from seeing 150 hours of commercials every year.</td>
	<td>As social media platforms become highly monetized and brands move toward including social commerce as part of their conversion strategy, it’s unsurprising that companies are looking to spend big on social media ads. After all, why wouldn’t you advertise where over 3.6 billion people regularly hang out?</td>
	<td>Pepsi Ad Theme: Pepsi, although selling the similar product as Coca-Cola but using entirely opposite ad theme in its ad campaigns. In their ads, they always promote youth energy, courage to take up challenges and new initiatives. Pepsi ads never talk about family values relationships and this feature is found in every Pepsi advertisement.</td>
	<td>Lack of adult reasoning is a concern because young children tend to accept ads as fair, accurate, balanced and truthful. They are not in the least aware of their persuasive intent. They do not see the exaggeration or the bias that underlies the claims. As such, they tend to believe all the commercials they see, which can lead to unhealthy habits and choices.</td>
	<td>Finally, teens are one of the most important demographics for marketers. Their brand preferences are still gelling, they have money to spend, and they exert a strong influence on their parents' spending (even on big-ticket items such as cars).</td>
	<td>Try limiting your own screen time as well: research shows that parent TV time has a stronger relationship to child TV time than access to TV in the home of the child’s bedroom, or even parental rules about TV viewing.</td>
	<td>So far, APA's Public Policy office has met with members of Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission to address advertising's effects on children. APA also plans to co-sponsor a briefing in Washington, D.C., this month with Children Now and the American Academy of Pediatrics about child-oriented ads delivered through digital media and multicasting technologies.</td>

<td> Be a Good Role Model
	Young kids learn a lot about how to act by watching their parents. The younger they are, the more cues they take from you. Before you lash out or blow your top in front of your child, think about this: Is that how you want your child to behave when angry? Be aware that you're constantly being watched by your kids. Studies have shown that children who hit usually have a role model for aggression at home.

	<td>Bonnie J. Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the Nativity or incarnation. Among the sources of confusion are:[5]
 		In modern times, incarnation is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as Bede, considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.
		</td>

	<td>Every manufacturer wants a recurring business, which leads them to create flashy advertisements. The result of this is the development of an impulse buying habit in children.
		False imaging is another issue with advertisements that present things or events in an unrealistic manner and children tend to fall for it.</td>

	<td>Advertisements commonly use young and beautiful women to promote beauty products. It has become a norm to use only fair-skinned women, creating the stereotype that fair skin is beautiful and acceptable in society. Similarly, some ads perpetuate the stereotype that a slim body is healthy and beautiful. Such ads might make children conscious of their appearance and develop a negative body image. These might also lead to eating disorders, such as bulimia or anorexia.
	</td>

	<td>Studies estimate that children between the ages of 6 and 11 spend on average 28 hours a week watching television[9] and are exposed to as many as 20,000 commercials in a single year.[10] Since the 1970s, there has been a large amount of concern as to whether or not children can comprehend advertisements and the extent to which they do so.</td>

	<td>"Children have a natural affinity and attraction towards visual communication. There is movement, colour, characters and sound. Children recognize these products at stores and start asking for them. This phenomenon has opened up a whole new target group for advertisers," says Mahima Bhanukumar, an advertising professional in Bangalore.</td>
	<td>Hooking them young. Getting the product in front of a target audience as much as possible strengthens a company's ability to capture consumers "from the cradle to the grave." Think cartoon characters on diapers.</td>
	<td> Encourage exposure to ads while in your presence
		No matter how much you try to reduce their exposure to advertising, your kids will still see ads, whether on buses, on buildings, or in the classroom. In fact, you may want to encourage a reasonable amount of exposure while in your presence. Dutch researchers found that “active mediation”—making deliberate comments and judgments about commercials and actively explaining their selling intent—was more effective than sheltering children from ads.</td>
	<td>The task force report, with its empirically based recommendations, is helping to guide such advocacy efforts and to do the same for research--both major goals, says APA Board of Directors member Barry Anton, PhD, who is also a member of APA's Council of Representatives.</td>

<td>  Make Communication a Priority
	You can't expect kids to do everything simply because you, as a parent, "say so." They want and deserve explanations as much as adults do. If we don't take time to explain, kids will begin to wonder about our values and motives and whether they have any basis. Parents who reason with their kids allow them to understand and learn in a nonjudgmental way.

<td>It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" shortly after "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.</td>
	<td>Advertisements may also develop a materialistic idea of the world in the children. When their innocent minds are regularly being exposed to content which portrays that having the best things is necessary for a comfortable life, it may make children give undue importance to material wealth.
		Brand consciousness and an affinity towards expensive branded items can be developed. This may make them shun inexpensive things that serve the same purpose.</td>
	<td>The constant bombardment of advertisements might dictate every moment of your child’s life, and before you realize it, they may begin to define themselves by what they have and what they don’t for who they are. This personality change can create a void in their lives, and they may try to fill it with materialistic things.

</td>
	<td>There are positive and negative implications to television advertising on young children, for both marketers and the children who view the advertisements. Many advertising aimed at children is criticized for enforcing gender stereotypes.[13] Some countries have broadcast codes that suggest that television advertisements should not contain exaggerated claims that will mislead or deceive children, abuse their trust or lack the understanding of persuasive intent in an advertisement.</td>
	<td>You heard it here first (well, in our Social Trends 2022 report) that short-form video is back en vogue. Thanks in part to the continued rise of Instagram Stories, Reels, and TikTok, snappy video content also translates to how marketers are reaching audiences with ads.</td>
	<td>A theme of advertising is a central, recurring idea or message intended to trigger desired action from the customers. It is the heart of advertising copy. Some of the popular themes used in the advertisements of different products are given below.

	<td>Children in modern homes have assumed larger roles. They have a say in buying household items, consumer durables, and even high-tech electronic gadgets. Television has come up in a big way over the last 20 years. Advertising is a mammoth industry with an enormous impact on the development of children. TV ads target unsuspecting children and as a result, kids nag, pester and demand that their parents purchase the advertised item.</td>
	<td>Dividing and targeting genders. Brands try to establish a preference for gendered toys as early as possible. The sooner your child has a desire for "boy" toys or "girl" toys, the sooner he or she becomes a customer. That opens the door for even more gendered products.</td>
	<td> Look for opportunities to help your kids understand what ads are and how to decode them; teach them the difference between a TV program and a commercial, showing them when a commercial begins and ends. Teach them to ask critical questions like: Who is responsible for the ad? What is it actually saying? Does it leave out any critical information? What does the ad want me to do?</td>
	<td>"We can use it to advocate to state legislators, organizations and foundations, and we can use the task force report as a way to request funding for research," says Anton, who chaired a subsequent task force on children and adolescents.</td>

<td>Be Flexible and Willing to Adjust Your Parenting Style
	If you often feel "let down" by your child's behavior, perhaps you have unrealistic expectations. Parents who think in "shoulds" (for example, "My kid should be potty-trained by now") might find it helpful to read up on the matter or to talk to other parents or child development specialists.

	<td>The Anglo-Saxon historian Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius Exiguus, used Anno Domini dating in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which he completed in AD 731. In the History he also used the Latin phrase ante [...] incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo ("in the sixtieth year before the time of the Lord's incarnation"), which is equivalent to the English "before Christ", to identify years before the first year of this era.</td>
	<td>A large portion of the food items advertised is junk food and are very visually appealing. These can influence the eating habits of the child and promote an unhealthy lifestyle.
		Advertisements can also be a leading factor in influencing the choice of toys, clothes or luxuries of a child.

	<td>Advertisements often contain false claims or exaggerated content with the intent to attract consumers and grab their interest. Children who are naive may believe them to be true and try to imitate dangerous stunts at home. Although these are accompanied by a statutory message, they are generally overshadowed by the advertisements’ pomp and show.</td>
	<td>Many parents report being pestered by their children for the product they have seen on television.[15][16] This phenomenon is dubbed "pester power", which means that little children pester their parents to buy things for them that they desire.[17] A study showed that mothers are more likely to purchase a product for their children due to the emotional appeal of their children's response to an advertisement.</td>
	<td>Surprisingly, half of adult internet users say that when brands use their data in advertising, it helps them discover (50%) and find (49%) products and services that interest them.Given that advertising has been in a bit of flux since Apple introduced additional privacy measures that allow iPhone users to opt-out of sharing trackable data, these statistics signal that all is not lost for marketers reliant on ads to grow their business.</td>
	<td>Comfort: – The advertisements for bath products, air conditioners, fans and other household appliances generally contain this feeling of comforts. Using this approach, advertisers hope to show how using the product could make a person life a little easier or more pleasant.
		Economy: – It is a common theme in clearance sale and bargain offers. This theme of advertising is generally used to sale products of low value.</td>
	<td>"Children less than 5 years of age are the ones most affected by ads. At that age, images they see get fixed in their mind. It is called object permanence. When they go to the supermarket, they choose the product which is fixated in their mind and the parents are more than happy to indulge, unaware whether that product is actually reliable or not," explains Dr S Yamuna, consultant paediatrician and adolescent physician in Chennai.

	<td>Dividing and targeting genders. Brands try to establish a preference for gendered toys as early as possible. The sooner your child has a desire for "boy" toys or "girl" toys, the sooner he or she becomes a customer. That opens the door for even more gendered products.</td>
	<td>Explain that they may unknowingly give advertisers a lot of information just by downloading an app or clicking on a sweepstakes. Teach them to ask your permission before clicking on an ad, participating in an online quiz, or filling out a form.</td>
	<td>Ultimately, such efforts aim to spotlight the question of fairness in child-directed advertising, says Dale Kunkel, PhD, senior author of the task force's report and professor of communication at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "Is it fair to allow advertising to an audience that is too young to recognize commercial messages are biased and have a persuasive intent?"</td>

<td> Show That Your Love Is Unconditional
	As a parent, you're responsible for correcting and guiding your kids. But how you express your corrective guidance makes all the difference in how a child receives it.
	When you have to confront your child, avoid blaming, criticizing, or fault-finding, which hurt self-esteem and can lead to resentment. Instead, try to nurture and encourage, even when disciplining your kids. Make sure they know that although you want and expect better next time, your love is there no matter what.</td>

	<td>On the continent of Europe, Anno Domini was introduced as the era of choice of the Carolingian Renaissance by the English cleric and scholar Alcuin in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor Charlemagne and his successors popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the Carolingian Empire ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. .</td>
	<td>The sexual objectification of women in some advertisements is a cause for concern, as children grow up to think that this is the norm.
		As many adverts have successfully managed to blur the line between real and reel life, children tend to believe the facade and lose touch with reality.</td>
	<td>One of the contributing factors behind childhood obesity is advertising. According to the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity, food companies spend almost $11 billion on TV advertising annually (3). Furthermore, a study conducted in Brazil found that 50% of the advertising directed towards children is related to food, and 80% of those are unhealthy foods high in sugar, fats, and salt (4). Advertisements present the wrong notion that consuming a specific drink or fast food makes children successful or happy.</td>
	<td>Critics have likewise communicated concern with respect to the predominance of promoting brutal media, for example, films and computer games, focusing on children. Three reports by the Federal Trade Commission discovered significant help for such charges, and keeping in mind that reviews have not legitimately surveyed the effect of such publicizing, revealing that such advertisements do influence children's media inclinations.</td>
	<td>52% of social media users say that when a platform protects their privacy and data, it’s incredibly impactful on their decision to interact with the ads or sponsored content they see on the channel.</td>
	<td>Health: – The drugs and food products are often advertised with this theme. E.g., for energy and vigor use i.e. Horlicks, Bournvita, etc.
		Beauty: This theme is used in advertisements for cosmetics, perfumeries, toilet soaps etc., for men and women.
		Parental Affection: -This theme is used to advertise products meant for children, e.g. toys, baby foods, baby dresses, tricycles, etc.</td>
	<td>"Ads have no positive impact on children as far as I know. An ad may be played for a maximum of 20 seconds and children get used to such short attention-paying spans. They tend to lose their patience very soon, the possible beginnings of an attention deficit disorder," she says.</td>
	<td>Developing taste preferences. Junk-food marketing to kids is a $2 billion-per-year industry. Cartoon characters appear on cereal boxes, toys appear inside boxes, and characters shill for brands on TV -- for example, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head advertise potato chips. And it works.</td>
	<td>Get to know which games and apps your child is using, and have them show you how they are used, what kind of information they ask for, and what sorts of awards they provide. Invest the time to really understand this content, and if you don’t approve of the marketing tactics, steer your kids toward games or apps that you find acceptable.</td>
	<td>Certainly the messages' power of persuasion is compelling, the task force found. Studies cited in the report have shown that after just one exposure to a commercial, children can recall the ad's content and have a desire for the product.</td>

	<td>Advertisements usually mock or compare products to show how one product is superior or better than the rest. Children might get influenced by these commercials and start comparing themselves with their peers or believing they are either superior or inferior to the rest. Such behavior may either lower their self-confidence or make them feel superior to others.

	</td>
	<td>Many advertisements involve children around the same age as the viewer. The latest technology; from laptops, and mobile phones, to toys are being advertised by companies to attract customers to buy their products. Companies now have new mediums and methods to spread their advertisements as a result of these emerging technologies.</td>
	<td>Ads on social media had worldwide revenue of $153 billion in 2021, and this number is expected to grow to over $252 billion in 2026. The first biggest advertising market? Search advertising.</td>
	<td>Fear: – The themes stressing fear of death, accident, personal loss through fire, burglary, etc., is used in the advertisements of insurance, safety vaults, etc. The traffic police also make use of this theme to caution people i.e. life is short don’t make is shorter’, ‘’Keep off the road, “Shun the anguish of an accident”, etc.</td>
	<td>A milk food ad claims that children who drink it will grow taller than those that drink other beverages. The truth: Height is largely determined by genetic factors, and no health drink can influence it.</td>
	<td>The need for stimulation. If you're wondering why commercials for tweens look like they were filmed by a caffeine-addled jackrabbit, it's because tween brains crave -- and respond strongly to -- stimulation. If something is exciting, they take notice.</td>
	<td>Stock your home with high-quality books, magazines, and articles for your kids to read. As Joe Kelly, a.k.a. The Dad Man, has noted, provide these materials even if your child hasn’t asked for them: “It’s like stocking the kitchen with healthy snacks, even if she begs only for chips and soda.”</td>
	<td>Certainly the messages' power of persuasion is compelling, the task force found. Studies cited in the report have shown that after just one exposure to a commercial, children can recall the ad's content and have a desire for the product.</td>
	<td>As your child helps with chores and cooking, he is learning a lot of self-help skills. This helps him become more independent and self-confident. As an added bonus, when your child helps with the cooking, even a fussy eater is fussy no more!</td>

<td>Avoid making loaded statements or using words as weapons. Comments like "What a stupid thing to do!" or "You act more like a baby than your little brother!" cause damage just as physical blows do.
	Choose your words carefully and be compassionate. Let your kids know that everyone makes mistakes and that you still love them, even when you don't love their behavior.Focusing on your needs does not make you selfish. It simply means you care about your own well-being, which is another important value to model for your children.</td>
	<td>When the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: Christmas, Annunciation, or Easter. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:[27]
	From 25 March 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first "Annunciation style" appeared in Arles at the end of the 9th century then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called calculus pisanus since it was adopted in Pisa and survived there until 1750.</td>
	<td>Unlike a few years ago, the marketing efforts of brands selling children’s products or even certain adult products these days are directly targeted at children. Hence, it becomes important for parents to become active participants in helping the children develop critical judgement of the advertisements and teaching them the value of the non-materialistic comforts in life.</td>
	<td>Brands usually create advertisements with a persuasive intent so that the users buy their products. By repeatedly watching these ads, children might resort to impulsive buying even when they do not need the product.</td>
	<td>The effect is seen mainly in young children. According to a study from the UK, it states that celebrities who endorse specific foods in television commercials are a powerful influence on children, and that effect may extend beyond the advertisement itself. That study contained 181 children, and was concluded that children ate more potato chips after seeing advertisements featuring a popular UK sports figure than children who only watched commercials for toys and nuts.</td>
	<td>But if brands want to make a splash, they’ll have to work harder to create ads that mirror and enrich the distinct experience each social network offers. Social media managers will need to get creative as the ad space becomes more competitive and produce high-quality content that mirrors each network’s distinct experience.</td>
	<td>Achievement: – Usually, this theme is used by large concerns engaged in the production of goods necessary for the development of country’s economy. e.g., ‘H.M.T Time keepers to the Nation’. There is a desire to imitate or emulate distinguished people, e.g.’, ‘successful men all over the world use.</td>
	<td>Any cereal ad implies that if the child has the cereal, there is no need for any other foods for the rest of the day. The truth: What they forget to mention is that the cereals are meant only for breakfast. The contents of the cereal contribute about 10%-15% of the daily dietary allowance.</td>
	<td>The desire to engage. Brands bury their sales pitches to this age. Preteens are swayed by experience, not lectures -- hence games, apps, contests, and other interactive gimmicks to attract and hold their attention.</td>
	<td>Gather other concerned parents or community members to do a walk-through of your school. Look for examples of sponsored materials such as textbooks, computer banner ads, vending machines, and cafeteria banners.</td>
	<td>Some messages may influence children's behavior too, says Brian Wilcox, PhD, chair of the task force, which formed in 2000 to conduct an extensive literature review of advertising's effects on children. For example, research has shown that child-directed ads for healthy foods can lose their effectiveness when children view ads for snack foods in the same sitting.</td>

<td>Teens seem to need less undivided attention from their parents than younger kids. Because there are fewer windows of opportunity for parents and teens to get together, parents should do their best to be available when their teen does express a desire to talk or participate in family activities. Attending concerts, games, and other events with your teen communicates caring and lets you get to know more about your child and his or her friends in important ways.

	<td>From 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called "Nativity style" and had been spread by Bede together with the Anno Domini in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style) and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.</td>
	<td>Cut down on the screen time. Limit the amount of time that your children are allowed to watch TV or use the computer. It is also advised that you monitor the content that your kids are watching.
		When your child asks for a specific product, initiate a conversation with them about why they want it. This will give you a chance to explain to them how advertising works.

	<td>Under the influence of advertisements, children might develop a liking for high-end and branded clothes, shoes, and other products. They may even develop a disregard towards other brands that offer products of the same levels of utility but are not featured in ads.</td>
	
	<td>One cause for concern for children is deceptive phone applications directed at them by appearing to be free, but have hidden fees within the app. In these instances, the initial download of the game application has no cost. However, when children are playing the game, there will be fees to gain new features for advancing to new levels.  </td>
	<td>Social media will account for 33% of all digital advertising spending in 2022
		And annual advertising spends on social media will top $134 billion in 2022, an increase of over 17% YOY (that’s an additional $23 billion!)</td>
	<td>Patriotism: – This theme is used by native firms to induce people to buy their products in place of imported products. For example, the slogan “Made in India” influences the attitudes of the people who believe in purchasing goods made in India only.</td>
	<td>The craving for emotional connection. If you have a tween, you know that kids at this age are not entirely rational. They LOVE a specific dress, they MUST HAVE a particular song, they're OBSESSED with a certain game. Marketers use strategies that stir up emotions so kids identify with a product.</td>

	<td>Indeed, some researchers speculate that advertising geared to children--which largely consists of ads for sugary cereals, candy and fast-food restaurants--may be contributing to the increase in childhood obesity by promoting unhealthy foods. Plus, studies suggest that eating habits formed during childhood can persist throughout life, according to the report.</td>
	<td>These brain exercises help boost your child's critical thinking, logical, and reasoning skills, all essential in getting your child ready for a future that demands creative thinkers and problem solvers.</td>
<td> Fuel the scientist and inventor in your child. These experiments may not lead to discoveries. But they help your child learn that it's okay to make mistakes and you need to keep trying before you get it right. Along the way, you never know what your child will discover and learn.</td>

<td>As your child changes, you'll gradually have to change your parenting style. Chances are, what works with your child now won't work as well in a year or two.
	Teens tend to look less to their parents and more to their peers for role models. But continue to provide guidance, encouragement, and appropriate discipline while allowing your teen to earn more independence. And seize every available moment to make a connection!</td>
	<td>The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.[28] The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating,[29] but the date is estimated through two different approaches—one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the ministry of Jesus.</td>
	<td>Point out the flaws in the advertisements that you cannot shield your child from and give a realistic picture to your child. This can help develop a critical judgement in the child.
		Try to download television programs to avoid having to watch advertisements with your child.
		Help your child learn the difference between ‘needs’ and ‘wants’. And teach them to only ask for something that they need.</td>
	<td>Some advertisements may contain violent and aggressive content geared toward adults. But when children watch these, they might misinterpret them and resort to bullying or demeaning peers or siblings. Such negative behaviors developed in early childhood may stay with them into adulthood.
</td>
	<td>Many studies have been conducted indicating an early exposure to food advertising to 2–13-year-old children has a link to the increasing number of childhood obesity cases globally.[26] The large exposure to commercial food has been linked to problems for children worldwide, among these problems the issue of child obesity.</td>
	<td>This doesn’t mean the end of running social ad campaigns on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. But, marketers will need to look towards modern-day favorites: TikTok, Pinterest, and Snapchat, to reallocate some of their ad budgets as these channels grow in popularity (especially TikTok).
	And because these channels are less saturated, there’s more chance of ads gaining traction and impressions.</td>
	<td>Curiosity: – Human mind is basically inquisitive and variety is the species of life. The eagerness for new things is so strong that this theme can be used through advertisement of new designs, styles, package, etc.
	</td>
	<td>Such is the impact of ads on children that it blurs the line between reel life and real life. "My children are now at a stage where they want everything that is advertised, from an Exo dishwasher to nappies (though they have outgrown them)," says Gayathri Pannicker, a mother of two children.</td>
	<td>Exploiting insecurities. Brands appealing to teens take advantage of their particular vulnerabilities: the desire to fit in, to be perceived as attractive, and to not be a huge dork. Teens are extremely attuned to their place in the peer hierarchy, and advertising acts as a kind of "super peer" in guiding them toward what's cool and what's acceptable.</td>

	There is so much experimentation that can happen in the kitchen - different recipes to try and new ones to innovate
	Get your child some science, engineering, and technology exploration kits
	Give recyclable material and see what new inventions your child comes up with.</td>
